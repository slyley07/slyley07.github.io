# Jetblack Landing Page

1. Pull down master branch.
2. Immediately create a new feature branch and make changes in that
3. Add and commit the code and push up to the repository.
4. Create a pull request but _do not_ merge.
5. [Netlify](www.netlify.com) will automatically create a test link for all pull requests using the request's number.
6. The styling for the link is `deploy-preview-[PULL REQUEST NUMBER]--holiday-jetblack.netlify.com`.
7. Send this link to the designers (Krystle and Laura) and Kevin for testing.
8. When they approve and Kevin says to push it live, complete the pull request.
